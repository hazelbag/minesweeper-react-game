# Minesweeper Game

## Detailed Instructions:

A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.

If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.

To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.

If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.

You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
